To use this Prework Study Guide, there is a webpage of notes on the uses of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript respectively. The user can open Chrome DevTools by right clicking the webpage and pressing Inspect and navigate to the console tab. From here, to choose what to study, there are subsections of the four topics to study and suggestion on what to study first.
